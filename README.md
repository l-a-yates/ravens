### About

This repository provides code to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript "Roadkill islands: carnivore extinction shifts seasonal use of roadside carrion by generalist avian scavenger" by Fielding, Matthew; Buettel, Jessie C; Brook, Barry; StojanoviÄ‡, Dejan; Yates, Luke (2021). 

The data are available from the accompanying repository [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14036807.v1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14036807.v1)


### Details  
The series of six R scripts *RavRK_0_prepare.R*, etc. reproduce the full set of results for the manuscript. Some of the more time-consuming computations have been saved as R data objects in the folder 'results'. The scripts contains comments to facilitate the loading of these objects. Alternatively, the analyses can be re-run in their entirety. 

An R markdown document containing a *simple worked example* is also supplied here; the html output can be viewed directly at [https://l-a-yates.github.io/ravens/RavRK_example](https://l-a-yates.github.io/ravens/RavRK_example)
